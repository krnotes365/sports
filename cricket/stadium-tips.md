# Tips for Stadium Visit

Are you going to watch a Cricket Match for the 1st time at Cricket Stadium?  There here are some tips I have collected from regular folks who goto stadium.

## DO's
1. Be at your Gate by max 1pm as 1.30pm is toss and 1:45pm is national anthem time 
2. Take Sunglasses
3. Take Cap
4. Take Wallet
5. Take Small Lady Purse
6. Carry Cash of Rs.1500 to Rs.2000 (as Mobile Network may get jammed and UPI may not work)
7. Conserve Mobile Phone battery by disabling Internet as its a 9 hours game
8. Bluetooth Headphones not allowed
9. There will be too much of rush at food counter during inning breaks, so avoid that time to eat. Go between the Overs. Avoid drinks during the break time too. 
10. If going to Chinnaswamy Stadium, use Metro Train.  Cubbon Park Metro Station is the nearest metro stop to get down. 

## DONT's
1. Power Bank
2. Big Lady Purse
